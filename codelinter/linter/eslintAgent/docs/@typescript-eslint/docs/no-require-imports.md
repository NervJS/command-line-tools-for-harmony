Disallow invocation of `require()`.

> See [***documentation***](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/{{region}}/doc/harmonyos-guides-{{apiVersion}}/ide_no-require-imports-{{apiVersion}}) for more details.

Prefer the newer ES6-style imports over `require()`.

## Examples

<!--tabs-->

### ❌ Incorrect

```ts
const lib1 = require('lib1');
const { lib2 } = require('lib2');
import lib3 = require('lib3');
```

### ✅ Correct

```ts
import * as lib1 from 'lib1';
import { lib2 } from 'lib2';
import * as lib3 from 'lib3';
```

## Options

### `allow`

A array of strings. These strings will be compiled into regular expressions with the `u` flag and be used to test against the imported path. A common use case is to allow importing `package.json`. This is because `package.json` commonly lives outside of the TS root directory, so statically importing it would lead to root directory conflicts, especially with `resolveJsonModule` enabled. You can also use it to allow importing any JSON if your environment doesn't support JSON modules, or use it for other cases where `import` statements cannot work.

With `{allow: ['/package\\.json$']}`:

### ❌ Incorrect

```ts
console.log(require('../data.json').version);
```

### ✅ Correct

```ts
console.log(require('../package.json').version);
```

## When Not To Use It

If your project frequently uses older CommonJS `require`s, then this rule might not be applicable to you.
If only a subset of your project uses `require`s then you might consider using [ESLint disable comments](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-comments-1) for those specific situations instead of completely disabling this rule.
