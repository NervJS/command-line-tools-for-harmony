When searching for the first item in an array matching a condition, it may be tempting to use code like `arr.filter(x => x > 0)[0]`.
However, it is simpler to use [Array.prototype.find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) instead, `arr.find(x => x > 0)`, which also returns the first entry matching a condition.
Because the `.find()` only needs to execute the callback until it finds a match, it's also more efficient.

Beware the difference in short-circuiting behavior between the approaches.
`.find()` will only execute the callback on array elements until it finds a match, whereas `.filter()` executes the callback for all array elements.
Therefore, when fixing errors from this rule, be sure that your `.filter()` callbacks do not have side effects.

### ❌ Incorrect

```ts
[1, 2, 3].filter(x => x > 1)[0];

[1, 2, 3].filter(x => x > 1).at(0);
```

### ✅ Correct

```ts
[1, 2, 3].find(x => x > 1);
```

## When Not To Use It

If you intentionally use patterns like `.filter(callback)[0]` to execute side effects in `callback` on all array elements, you will want to avoid this rule.
